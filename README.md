## Repo where I will practice writing ML algorithms from scratch:

### linear_regression:
#### This notebook explores algorithms commonly applied for solving linear regression. Currently, the following algorithms have been coded and explored:
* Normal Equation - Provides an analytical solution
* Gradient Descent
* Stochastic Gradient Descent

#### Future algorithms will come from this [list](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) and will likely include at least:
* Mini-batch gradient descent
* Applying a 'momentum' term to SGD
* Adagrad
